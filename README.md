# DreamScore API
This document provides an overview of the DreamScore API, which is described using OpenAPI specifications.

## OpenAPI Specification
The API is described using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS), a language-agnostic standard for describing RESTful APIs. The specification for the DreamScore API is located in the dreamscore.yaml file in the root of the repository.

You can view and interact with the API using any tool that supports OpenAPI, such as Swagger UI or Bruno.

To install the plugin:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
3. Search for "OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor".
